This package implements the "run_style mist" command which can be used
in a LAMMPS input script.

This fix enables the MIST library to be used in a LAMMPS simulation, providing portable
access to a number of novel integration schemes.

This package uses an external library in lib/mist which must be
compiled before making LAMMPS.  See the lib/mist/README file and the
LAMMPS manual for information on building LAMMPS with external
libraries.  The settings in the Makefile.lammps file in that directory
must be correct for LAMMPS to build correctly with this package
installed.
